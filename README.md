[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3ndbep7qd1jdyic1?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Tak1wa/videouwp)

This application is a UWP application that downloads movie files from multiple Internet sites and keeps playing them every 10 seconds.

Personally created to check the video playback ability of Windows 10 IoT Core.
